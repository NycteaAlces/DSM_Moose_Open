Background:
This tool was created to rapidly assess the progress of an ungulate survey, provide information on the conformity of the survey crew to the detection function and provide an estimate of baseline precision and density estimates for the target species. This tool is intended to evaluate the efficacy of a survey as it progresses, and to facilitate the adaptive delivery of the survey (e.g. patterns of precision and effort) and also to inform if any issues with comformity are occuring so that they can be corrected. This tool should not be used for final results and should always be followed by a comprehensive analysis that incorporates other analytical considerations (e.g. careful truncation, detection function model fit, group size influences, covariates and possible stratifications). 

Data inputs:
The inputs required are the standardized access database that was created by Alberta Environment and Parks for the compilation of distance sampling data and a shapefile of the survey area(s). You can also specify a shapefile for the survey area which will plot a map of the flown transects and species observations withint he database file.

Usage: 
This tool was created for internal use within Alberta Environment and Parks.
